	<p>For Stanford Court reservations, please note that to receive the discounted group rate, you need to book the room for both Friday and Saturday nights. If you try to book using the group code for only one night, the system may tell you there are no available rooms. </p>

			San Francisco can be reached via public transportation from all 3 of the international airports servicing the Bay Area: <a href="http://www.flysfo.com">San Francisco (SFO)</a>, <a href="http://www.oaklandairport.com">Oakland (OAK)</a>, and <a href="http://www.flysanjose.com">San Jose (SJC)</a>. The closest airport is SFO from which you can take <a href="http://www.bart.gov">BART</a> to downtown. You can also take BART from OAK. From SJC, you can take a bus to <a href="http://www.caltrain.com">Caltrain</a>, but this option will take longer than the other two airports.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your hotel may also offer a shuttle service from the airport, so make sure to enquire.
